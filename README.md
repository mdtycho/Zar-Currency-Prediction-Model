# Zar-Currency-Prediction-Model
Model to predict South African rand (zar) movements against the US dollar. This is the only project that is not part of the Explore Data Science portfolio as of now, I worked on this during two weeks in July while we were on vacation from the academy for a company in Cape Town that has given me permission to use the code as part of my portfolio.
